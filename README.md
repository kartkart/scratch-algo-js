# scratch-algo-js

This repository is simply a new, more nerdish clone of leetcode. There are simple few differences to leetcode, here they are;

1. More nerdish.
2. If you prefer to run tests through circleci, then your solutions is open source by concept.
3. If you like you can clone the project to your computer and develop solutions with your comfortable IDE.
4. Innovative: nothing hosted - everything works on github & circleci or github & your computer.
5. Easy to contribute.
6. Provides opportunity for people who didn't work with github & circleci before to practice them.

## How it works?
1. Fork the repository to your account.
2. Pick a question (e.g., [Rotation](https://github.com/engintekin/scratch-algo-js/tree/master/Rotation))
3. Edit `solution.js` ([Editing files in your repository](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/))
4. Write your commit message (e.g. _solves rotation problem_)
5. Create a *new branch* and start a pull request to the original repo

Now you can see [circleci](https://circleci.com/gh/engintekin/scratch-algo-js) will start running the tests against your solution and hopefully your solution will succeed. Now start hacking by forking it.
